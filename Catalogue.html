                                Krishna, who serves as his charioteer. This dialogue takes place on the battlefield just
                                before the Kurukshetra War, where Arjuna is filled with moral dilemma and despair about
                                fighting in the battle. Arjuna is confused and morally troubled about fighting in the
                                war against his own relatives, friends, and teachers. In response to Arjuna's confusion,
                                Krishna imparts spiritual wisdom and guidance to Arjuna. He discusses various paths to
                                spiritual realization, the nature of reality, the self, duty (dharma), righteousness,
                                and the paths to liberation (moksha). The Gita addresses the concepts of duty,
                                righteousness, and devotion, and it explores the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by
                                individuals. It teaches the paths of devotion, action, and knowledge, emphasizing the
                                importance of selfless action and devotion to God.</b></Details>

                    one of the three giants of 19th century psychology alongside Freud and Jung, the authors explain how
                    we are all free to determine our own future free of the shackles of past experiences, doubts and the
                    expectations of others. It's a philosophy that's profoundly liberating, allowing us to develop the
                    courage to change, and to ignore the limitations that we and those around us can place on ourselves.

                    The result is a book that is both highly accessible and profound in its importance. Millions have
                    already read and benefited from its wisdom. Now that The Courage to be Disliked has been published
                    for the first time in English, so can you.</b></Details>
